\noindent
Dear Sir or Madam,
\newline

\noindent
I am writing to apply for the position entitled Fluid Dynamics Engineer 
(ref: PS5860).
I am a PhD student at CERFACS, 
a research center interested in applying Computational Fluid Dynamics
tool to analyze industrial fluid dynamics problems.
I am particularly interested in turbomachines
a skill that I have developed through all my 
experiences at CERFACS, Liebherr, ISAE and Safran-Snecma.
\newline

\noindent
As a student extremely interested by Turbomachinery, 
I ran my first CFD calculation on Fine/Turbo and enjoyed the 
user-friendly oriented interface and the fact that all the 
software communicates with each other (Autogrid simply gives 
all the information to Fine/ Turbo). This pleasant experience was 
confirmed with my benchmark project of Fine/Turbo and elsA 
(CFD code developed by ONERA), where I felt that all the efforts 
made by Numeca International were worth it and correspond to my personality. 
Therefore I would like to work in the company that has enhanced 
the CFD experience and will continue to do so.
\newline

\noindent
Numeca International requires engineers who can give 
help to all of its users with passion, knowledge and 
communication skills. Through my experience as a team 
leader in Mac Donald's, as a member of a music band 
and part of a rugby team, I have developed the abilities 
to communicate with others. As a Frenchmen I can think 
differently and bring new points of view to your division. 
A new way of thinking is always a benefit for work, 
it brings new perspectives and new ideas. My studies have 
also taught me all the fundamentals of CFD calculation 
on turbomachinery and on other systems. Through these 
studies and my user experience on Fine/Turbo, I have gathered 
a wide knowledge of them. As can be seen from my résumé, 
I will do a 6 month internship at C.E.R.F.A.C.S., 
a calculation center that uses Autogrid. My job will be 
to make LES calculations on the NASA rotor 37. Working in one 
of Numeca's divisions would allow me to learn more about 
the company that provides advanced CFD software. 
I am sure my motivation and my skills will prove useful to you.
\newline

\noindent
I am available until first October 2010 and I am seeking 
a full time job. I would be pleased to give you any 
further information you require. If you would like me 
to call for an interview, I shall be pleased to do so 
at your convenience. I look forward to hearing from you 
and thank you in advance for considering my application.
