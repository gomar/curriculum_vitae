# Skills & Abilities
## Summary
- Forthcoming Ph.D. in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with application to unsteady compressible aerodynamics (mainly turbomachines and propellers). Defence expected in February 2014
- Master degree in Aerospace Engineering
- Advanced level in English: wrote reports and publications related to my work, made technical presentations and animated meetings

## Communication
- Promulgated Antares software: designed a website (www.cerfacs.fr/antares) with tutorials and promoted it to industrial partners (Airbus, Snecma, Turbomeca)
- Presentation skills: made several technical presentations for a large audience (>30 people), skilful use of design rules (colour schemes, diagrams instead of text, clarity of slides)

## Leadership skills
Developed my leadership skills through a team leader position at Mc Donald’s (team of 15 people)

## Computer skills 
- Used several software programs dedicated to CFD: elsA, Fine/Turbo and Fluent
- Proficient in Python, NumPy, Scipy (Free Matlab equivalent). Ability with object oriented programming languages (Python, C++, Java). Developed Antares post-processing library (www.cerfacs.fr/antares)
- Used Git control version system

# Experience
## 2011 up to now
CERFACS & Arts et Métiers ParisTech, Toulouse, France, Research work as PhD candidate
entitled ”Counter rotating open rotor aeroelasticity”, I currently:
- extend a reduce order method for the unsteady weak coupling of aeroelasticity in turbomachines within an industrial CFD code (elsA),
- validate the model against experimental data on a reference configuration,
- explain the limitations of the model and improve its robustness for industrial applications,
- apply the method on an industrial contra-rotating open rotor configuration,
- develop a post-processing library written in python (www.cerfacs.fr/antares) for large simulation databases. Promote it: development of a website and presentations to industrial partners (Airbus, Snecma, Turbomeca) and train people to its use,
- teach Fluid Dynamics at ISAE (graduate school of Aerospace Engineering)

## 2010 (6 months)
CERFACS, Toulouse, France, Engineering internship
Computed Large Eddy Simulation of a high-pressure compressor stage. 
Post-processed and analyzed large simulations (>Go). 
Compared the results to experimental data.

## 2009 (3 months)
LIEBHERR Aerospace, Toulouse, France, Engineering internship
Benchmarked two CFD software programs: elsA and Fine/Turbo on a centrifugal compressor

## 2008-2009
Institut Supérieur de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace (ISAE), Toulouse, France, Long student project
Set an experimental approach to analyze an airplane extract fan. 
Benchmarked experimental and simulation results (using Fine/Turbo). Presented the results to an industrial partner (Technofan)

## 2007-2009 (2.5 years)
Mc Donald’s, Toulouse, France, Student job
Team leader. Managed a team of 15 people with good interpersonal skills and team spirit. 
Trained new recruits to Mc Donald’s standards

# Education
## Feb 2014 (expected)
Arts et Métiers ParisTech & CERFACS, Paris, France
PhD in Computational Fluid Dynamics with application to unsteady compressible aerodynamics

## Sept 2010
Institut Supérieur de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace (ISAE), Toulouse, France
MS in Aerospace Engineering, specialisation in experimental/computational fluid dynamics and turbomachines
